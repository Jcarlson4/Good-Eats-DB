# Relational Database

The database I'm using for this is the MYSQL database.

Eventually this database will be used in my safe eats web app which will tell whether or not a food is safe to eat. Within this database, i can store as many foods as i want along with pets. I used a singular table for ease of access and manipulation.

# Development Environment

I used Visual code studio and MYSQL workbench.

I used python to do the majority of the heavy lifting with workbench to check my work. I used the mysql.connector library.

# Future Work

Expand the information within the database
Think of a structure to add in other tables.
